1. get rid of the time line popup screen
2. end trial at a set time that is user defined
3. dropdown to select the trial you want 
4. change escape key to cancel AND SAVE, right now its just cancel. update the text on screen as well.
5. use spacebar to start a new trial and that would also mean the recording starts in the LOOKING state. 
6. keyboard shortcut to move to the next trial (maybe enter since its not being used right now)
